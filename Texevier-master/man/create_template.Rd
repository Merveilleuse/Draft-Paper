\description{
This function builds a template directory  with all the necessary files, as well as a rmarkdown script which is ready to edit.
The result is an Elsevier ready document that conforms to most academic journal standards.
In the directory folder provided, the user will have the tex files, as well as all relevant figure folders created in R. These should not be renamed or moved.
Prior to submitting a paper, the user should zip the template_name.tex file, together with the figure files and Tex folder, and send it through to journal editors.
Feel free to edit any of the settings in the template_name.tex file to conform to particular preferences (e.g. setting margins, etc.)
